react-SVGPieTimer
================

React component for an animated SVG Pie Timer.

Recommended use
---------------

```javascript
<SVGPieTimer
	height={250}
	width={250}
	duration={2000}
	loops={2}
/>
```

Properties
---------------
As seen above, you will need the following properties:

`width` (mandatory) Set the width of the svg. 

`height` (mandatory) Set the height of the svg. 

`duration` (optional) Set duration in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000.

`loops` (optional) Set amount of spins. Set to 0 for infinite spins. Defaults to 1.

Pie colors
---------------
You can set the color for the inner circle and the outer circle by setting the values in these classes:

```css
.svg-loader { 
  fill: #0088cc;
}

.svg-border { 
  fill: #00517a;
}
```

requestAnimationFrame
---------------
To optimize for performance, I've decided to use requestAnimationFrame. Browser support is good, but could have been better. I recommend using a polyfill for older browsers like IE9. Personally I prefer [this one](https://github.com/darius/requestAnimationFrame) by Darius Bacon, based on the polyfill by Erik MÃ¶ller.
